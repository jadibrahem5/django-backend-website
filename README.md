project:
This project is a Django web application that allows users to share their exercise routines and set monthly or weekly goals related to their fitness and health. The application is designed to be user-friendly and engaging, with a focus on community and social interaction.

Upon signing up, users can create their own profiles and share details about their fitness journey, such as their current fitness level, their preferred types of exercise, and their goals for the future. Users can also create and share their exercise routines, including details such as the exercises, sets, and reps, and they can browse and search routines created by other users.
